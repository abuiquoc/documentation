The Copernicus Data Hub distribution service will continue offering access to Sentinel data  with a gradual ramp-down of the operations capacity and data offering until end of September 2023.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Comparing with existing legacy Copernicus Data Hub, what will be the other free services other than stac/cog?</summary>\n    <div>\n    Compared to existing Copernicus Data Hub, there will indeed be additional APIs - OGC interfaces (WMS, WMTS, WCS), OpenEO, Sentinel Hub API, S3, and others. Please refer to the <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> for more info on the timing of these interfaces.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Is there an end user document available online that describes the specific data products available and specific services?</summary>\n    <div>\n    The user level document describing the details for every service and dataset can be found <a href=\"#/Applications/Browser\">here</a>(LINK WILL LATER BE UPDATED).\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>How long is the project timescale in total ?</summary>\n    <div>\n   The time scale of the project is 6 years (ie. to the end of 2028) with an optional extension up to 10 years (ie. 2032).\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Can anyone outside from Europe have free access to any data?</summary>\n    <div>\n   Yes, data and services will be available to users worldwide.\n    </div>\n</details>\n\n## Data\n\n<details>\n  <summary>What data will be offered online and what is the timeline for the following months?</summary>\n    <div>\n    For the details on the data offer and timing, we would like to refer to the <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a>\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Is there a page that indicates anomalies with the datasets?</summary>\n    <div>\n    A dashboard where any user can find planned and unplanned anomalies per Sentinel satellite is under construction and should be availabe in a short timeframe.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>With regard to cloud native formats/interfaces, will the data also be available in the original data formats (e.g. for data downloading)?</summary>\n    <div>\n    Yes, data will also be available in original data formats (i.e. .SAFE).\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>At the moment some of the data are delivered in Jpeg2000, is there any plan to abandon that format for the COG?</summary>\n    <div>\n    There is currently no plan to convert Sentinel-2 in COGs. However, there is a parallel activity happening within ESA to define format evolution for all Sentinels which will be followed, once decisions are taken. But this is not something that is happening on the short term.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Will data, such as Sentinel-2, be processed to a consistent version?</summary>\n    <div>\n    The Sentinel-2 data will be available at the latest processing baseline. And with the reprocessing of Sentinel-2 happening in parallel (out of scope of this project), these will become available on this service as well.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Is it possible to download a subset of data corresponding to an AOI, instead of the whole image?</summary>\n    <div>\n    Yes, you will be able to download a subset of data, either using S3 interface, or dedicated APIs, i.e. Sentinel Hub, OpenEO when they become available. See <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> section of the documentation.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Are the data offered via Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (also Level 1)?</summary>\n    <div>\n    Sentinel-1 GRD data will be available in COG format. Sentinel-2 will stay in JP2 for the moment, as it is a similarly performant cloud optimised format.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>When \"on-line data\" is mentioned, does that mean the data are not on tape?</summary>\n    <div>\n    The “on-line data” or IAD we are referring to, are indeed not on the tapes.  Tapes will still be there for redundancy reasons.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>For the S3 access in the free tier, will there be no cost for network traffic?</summary>\n    <div>\n    S3 access will be part of free services as well, within the same constraints as the rest of the services.\n    </div>\n</details>\n<details>\n  <summary>Can we download the data acquired by all Sentinel missions (1, 2, 3, 5P, 6) and the other satellites (e.g. Meteosat) via the new interface?
