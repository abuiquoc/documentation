# Service Desk

If the documentation portal does not provide the solution to your questions related to the use of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem, this page describes how to ask for support. 

## Prerequisites

Important to know is that only users with a Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem account can ask for support. 
If you don't have one yet, you can register [here](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cdse-public&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdataspace.copernicus.eu&response_type=code&scope=openid).
If you have an issue with registering or you want to deregister, please [contact us](mailto://help-login@dataspace.copernicus.eu?Subject=Subject%20Text&Body=Your%20comments) directly.

## Step 1: Sign in to CloudFerro JIRA

Navigate to the following [website](https://jira.cloudferro.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/55). You should see the following form:

## Accessing the submitted tickets

After logging in (as described in Step 1), you can see the status of your tickets. Click the Requests button in the upper right corner of the website:

If you can’t see your ticket here, make sure that the option Any status from the first drop-down menu is selected:

This system is the initial setup of the support desk of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. From April 2023 onwards, we will provide much more integrated support functionalities such as answer suggestions and a user forum.
