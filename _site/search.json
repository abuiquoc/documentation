Interface supports the following search options:\n\nfilter\norderby\ntop\nskip\ncount\nexpand\n\nSearch options should always be preceded with $ and consecutive options should be separated with &.\nConsecutive filters within filter option should be separated with and or or. Not operator can also be used e.g.:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=not contains(Name,'S2') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start

and ContentDate/Start lt 2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z\nUsually, there are two parameters describing the ContentDate (Acquisition Dates) for a product - Start and End. Depending on what the user is looking for, these parameters can be mixed, e.g.:\n[https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=ContentDate/Start gt 2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/End lt 2019-05-15T00:05:00.000Z](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\)filter=ContentDate/Start%20gt%202019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/End%20lt%202019-05-15T00:05:00.000Z)\n\n\n\nTo search for products intersecting the specified polygon:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=OData.CSC.Intersects(area=geography'SRID=4326;POLYGON((12.655118166047592 47.44667197521409,21.39065656328509 48.347694733853245,28.334291357162826 41.877123516783655,17.47086198383573 40.35854475076158,12.655118166047592 47.44667197521409))') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-20T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-21T00:00:00.000Z\nTo search for products intersecting the specified point:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=OData.CSC.Intersects(area=geography%27SRID=4326;POINT(-0.5319577002158441%2028.65487836189358)%27)\nDisclaimers:\n\nMULTIPOLYGON is currently not supported.\nPolygon must start and end with the same point.\nCoordinates must be given in EPSG 4326\n\n\n\n\nTo search for products by attributes it is necessary to build a filter with the following structure:\nAttributes/OData.CSC.ValueTypeAttribute/any(att:att/Name eq '[Attribute.Name]' and att/OData.CSC.ValueTypeAttribute/Value eq '[Attribute.Value]')\nwhere\n\nValueTypeAttribute can take the following values:\n\nStringAttribute\nDoubleAttribute\nIntegerAttribute\nDateTimeOffsetAttribute\n\n[Attribute.Name] is the attribute name which can take multiple values, depending on collection (Attachment 1 - Coming soon)\neq before [Attribute.Value] can be substituted with le, lt, ge, gt in case of Integer, Double or DateTimeOffset Attributes\n[Attribute.Value] is the specific value that the user is searching for\n\nTo get products with CloudCover<40% between two dates:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=Attributes/OData.CSC.DoubleAttribute/any(att:att/Name eq 'cloudCover' and att/OData.CSC.DoubleAttribute/Value le 40.00) and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-01-03T00:00:00.000Z&$top=10\nTo get products with cloudCover< 10% and productType=S2MSI2A and ASCENDING orbitDirection between two dates:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?$filter=Attributes/OData.CSC.DoubleAttribute/any(att:att/Name eq 'cloudCover' and att/OData.CSC.DoubleAttribute/Value lt 10.00) and Attributes/OData.CSC.StringAttribute/any(att:att/Name eq 'productType' and att/OData.CSC.StringAttribute/Value eq 'S2MSI2A') and Attributes/OData.CSC.StringAttribute/any(att:att/Name eq 'orbitDirection' and att/OData.CSC.StringAttribute/Value eq 'ASCENDING') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-03T04:00:00.000Z&$top=10\n\n\n\nOrderby option can be used to order the products in an ascending (asc) or descending (desc) direction. If asc or desc not specified, then the resources will be ordered in ascending order.\nTo order products by ContentDate/Start in a descending direction:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,'S1A_EW_GRD') and ContentDate/Start gt 2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z and ContentDate/Start lt 2022-05-03T03:00:00.000Z&\\)orderby=ContentDate/Start desc\nBy default, if orderby option is not used, the results are not ordered. If orderby option is used, additional orderby by id is also used, so that the results are fully ordered and no products are lost while paginating through the results.\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: ContentDate/Start, ContentDate/End, PublicationDate, ModificationDate, in directions: asc, desc.\n\n\n\nTop option specifies the maximum number of items returned from a query.\nTo limit the number of results:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)top=100\nThe default value is set to 20.\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: Integer <0,1000>\n\n\n\n\nSkip option can be used to skip a specific number of results. Exemplary application of this option would be paginating through the results, however for performance reasons, we recommend limiting queries with small time intervals as a substitute of using skip in a more generic query.\nTo skip a specific number of results:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)skip=23\nThe default value is set to 0.\nWhenever a query results in more products than 20 (default top value), the API provides a nextLink at the bottom of the page:\n\"@OData.nextLink\":\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,'S1A_EW_GRD')+and+ContentDate/Start+gt+2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z+and+ContentDate/Start+lt+2022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)skip=20\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: Integer <0,10000>\n\n\n\nCount option enables users to get the exact number of products matching the query. This option is disabled by default to accelerate the query performance.\nTo get the exact number of products for a given query:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)count=True\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: True, true, 1, False, false, 0.\n\n\n\nExpand option enables users to see full metadata of each returned result.\nTo see the metadata of the results:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products?\\(filter=contains(Name,%27S1A_EW_GRD%27)%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20gt%202022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z%20and%20ContentDate/Start%20lt%202022-05-03T12:00:00.000Z&\\)expand=Attributes\nThe acceptable arguments for this option: Attributes\n\n\n\nFor downloading products you need an authorization token as only authorized users are allowed to download data products.\nTo get the token you can use the following scripts:\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'username=<LOGIN>' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'password=<PASSWORD>' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'client_id=cdse-public'\nor\n'-d 'password=' -d 'grant_type=password' 'https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token' | python -m json.tool | grep \"access_token\" | awk -F\\\" '{print $4}')]]>\nAlong with the Access Token you will be returned a Refresh Token, the latter is used to generate a new Access Token without the need to specify Username or Password, this helps to make requests less vulnerable to your credentials being exposed.\nTo re-generate the Access Token from the Refresh Token it can be done with the following request:\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/token' \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'grant_type=refresh_token' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'refresh_token=<REFRESH_TOKEN>' \\\n  --data-urlencode 'client_id=cdse-public'\n\n\nOnce you have your token, you require a product Id which can be found in the response of the products search: https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products\nFinally, you can download the product using this script:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $KEYCLOAK_TOKEN\" 'https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products(060882f4-0a34-5f14-8e25-6876e4470b0d)/$value' --output /tmp/product.zip\nor\n\n\nCode\n!wget  --header \"Authorization: Bearer $KEYCLOAK_TOKEN\" 'http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/odata/v1/Products(db0c8ef3-8ec0-5185-a537-812dad3c58f8)/$value' -O example_odata.zip\n\n\n'wget' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file."

    "text": "Due to the fact that offset is not a recommended form of searching repository pages, we had to implement limit to a maximum of 200k. The requests over the limit will be rejected with the code 400. We encourage you to limit your inquiries by geographic or temporal area.\nAll queries may be executed as simple HTTP-Get calls, by typing the query in web browser address line, by using any HTTP client, e.g. curl or wget, or from inside of users’ program. The database is accessible free and anonymously (open for anonymous access for everyone, no authorization is used) It may be accessed both from the internal network (virtual machines in Creodias) and from outside, e.g. your home computer. Note, that the actual EO data themselves are restricted to authorized users, only the Data Catalogue is open.\n\n\nThe queries produce results in JSON format. Base url:\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/search.json?\nMost queries are case-sensitive.\n\n\n\nThe data are organized in so-called collections, corresponding to various satellites. A query may search for data in all collections, or in one particular collection only. If only one satellite is in the field of interest, the second approach is faster and more efficient, than filtering the general query. For example, to find 10 most recent Sentinel-2 products with cloud cover below 10%, the query should look like:\n$ wget -O - \"http://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10\"\nwhile if the collection field is missing in the URL, the products from all the satellites are returned:\n$ wget -O - \"https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10\"\nAs for today the following collections are defined and may be used:\nSentinel1 or SENTINEL-1\nSentinel2 or SENTINEL-2\nSentinel3 or SENTINEL-3\nSentinel5P or SENTINEL-5P\nNote, that collection names vary a bit from satellite names, as they are used in EO Data repository. For example, the collection is named Sentinel2, while in the repository its data are located within /eodata/Sentinel-2/…. branch of the repository tree.\n\n\n\nBy default, maximum 20 products are returned only. You may change the limit (beware of long execution time for queries about thousands of products) using the phrase\nmaxRecords=nnn\nIf the query is very general and the number of matching products is large, the next pages of products may be retrieved\npage=nnn\nYou may also change the order of how the products are presented, using the phrase like\nsortParam=startDate\nwill sort the output by observation date. The following orderings are implemented:\nstartDate - the date when the observation was made (start)\ncompletionDate - the date when the observation was made (end)\npublished  - the date when the product got published in our repository\neach of them may be accompanied by\nsortOrder=ascending or sortOrder=descending\nFor example the query\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01&completionDate=2021-07-31&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20\nwill return 20 products from July 2021, while the next query would return the next 20:\nhttp://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?startDate=2021-07-01&completionDate=2021-07-31&sortParam=startDate&maxRecords=20&page=2\n\n\n\nThe formal query is invoked as a sequence of sub phrases, separated by &. The result is a conjunction of all sub phrases. It is impossible to use an alternative in the question. The query must be specified as a formal query.\nThe example of formal query - about cloudless (cloud cover lower or equal to 10%) products for a specific location:\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2021-06-21&completionDate=2021-09-22&lon=21.01&lat=52.22\nThe queries are in form param=value or param=[minvalue,maxvalue**]. Most of the parameters are common for all collections, but some are specific for some them (e.g. cloudCover** applies to optical satellites, but polarisation applies to radar ones), or just single one.\n\n\n\nThe common set of parameters are:\nstartDate, completionDate - the date limits of the observation. The time may also be specified, e.g. 2021-10-01T021:30:00Z\npublishedAfter, publishedBefore - the date limits when the product was published in our repository\nlon, lat - geographical position, expressed in military style (EPSG:4326, as decimal fraction of degrees, positive for eastern latitude and northern longitude) radius - region of interest, defined as a circle with centre in point determined by the longitude and latitude with radius expressed in meters (it won’t work with point manually selected in EOFinder/Data Explorer)\ngeometry - region of interest, defined as WKT string (POINT, POLYGON, etc.)\nbox - region of interest, defined as the rectangle with given (west,south,east,north) values\nbox is defined this way: &box=west,south,east,north\nFor example the query\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10&box=-1,1,-1,1\nor\nhttps://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/resto/api/collections/Sentinel2/search.json?cloudCover=[0,10]&startDate=2022-06-11&completionDate=2022-06-22&maxRecords=10&box=-21,23,-24,15\n\n\n\nSome terrain-like feature masks are not permanent but describing a single scene only. The most commonly used such feature is cloudiness, or cloudCover, which is defined for most of the products coming from optical sensors. For example:\ncloudCover=[0,10]\nselects only those scenes, which are covered by clouds by no more than 10%.\nCaution: to be meaningful, the cloudiness must be provided with each product, while in many products is missing. If the cloudiness is unknown for the scene, it is marked by a value of 0 or -1. cloudCover=0 is therefore ambiguous: it may either mean totally cloudless sky or the cloudy scene for which cloud cover had not been estimated during original data processing.\n\n\n\ninstrument - meaningful only for satellites equipped with multiple instruments. The possible values are satellite specific.\nproductType - the actual types possible are specific for every satellite.\nsensorMode - also satellite and sensor specific. E.g.

But this is not something that is happening on the short term.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill data, such as Sentinel-2, be processed to a consistent version?\n\n\nThe Sentinel-2 data will be available at the latest processing baseline. And with the reprocessing of Sentinel-2 happening in parallel (out of scope of this project), these will become available on this service as well.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIs it possible to download a subset of data corresponding to an AOI, instead of the whole image?\n\n\nYes, you will be able to download a subset of data, either using S3 interface, or dedicated APIs, i.e. Sentinel Hub, OpenEO when they become available. See <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> section of the documentation.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre the data offered via Cloud Optimized Geotiffs (also Level 1)?\n\n\nSentinel-1 GRD data will be available in COG format. Sentinel-2 will stay in JP2 for the moment, as it is a similarly performant cloud optimised format.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhen “on-line data” is mentioned, does that mean the data are not on tape?\n\n\nThe “on-line data” or IAD we are referring to, are indeed not on the tapes.  Tapes will still be there for redundancy reasons.\n</div>\n\n\n\nFor the S3 access in the free tier, will there be no cost for network traffic?\n\n\nS3 access will be part of free services as well, within the same constraints as the rest of the services.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan we download the data acquired by all Sentinel missions (1, 2, 3, 5P, 6) and the other satellites (e.g. Meteosat) via the new interface? Some missions are not managed by ESA, but by EUMETSAT for example.\n\n\nInitialy Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, Sentinel 3 and Sentinel 5P data up to L2 products will be available. Sentinel 6 data and data from Meteosat are currently not in the roadmap of the project. However access to Copernicus Contributing Missions CORE Datasets, Digital Elevation Models, data from Copernicus Services and additional data sets such as Landsat and ENVISAT and Belgian Collaborative Ground Segment hosted data are planned in the future. The <a href=\"#/Roadmap/DataTable.html\">Data Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data will become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill it still be the case that data is labelled as “on/offline” on the current legacy portal?\n\n\nThe vast majority of the data will be on-line : all Sentinel-2 L1C/L2A, Sentinel-1 SLC/GRD  and just about all other relevant data collections.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill the new interface offer EO ready-to-use products or just L0 and L1 data?\n\n\nUp to L2 products will be available. The <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhen we develop an EO ready-to-use product, could we integrate it into the interface and ask the payment from clients?\n\n\nYes, commercial services can be built on top, similar to Copernicus open license.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan the user come with wish-list to services data products?\n\n\nUser can come with suggestions to improve or expand the service portfolio. A user forum will be set up and released by July to accommodate this.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre you going to develop new services on DAS after July 2023?\n\n\nYes, a marketplace will be available where new Third party services will be able to onboard from July onwards to expand the ecosystem.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIs there any limitation on the max number of downloads at one time?\n\n\nYes, there will be quotas and constraints for different services.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill there be an integrated free and commercial offering to support/encourage the transfer of the users from “try basics for free towards paid subscriptions”?\n\n\nYes, there will be a common user identity, which will allow registered users to seamlessly transfer between systems. This will also extend to other systems that will be added to the free tier to the commerical tier ecosystem in the future, assuming they will integrate it.\n</div>\n\n\n\nIf I’m having troubles with registering, what can I do?\n\n\nPlease e-mail the help-cdse-login@dataspace.copernicus.eu address for direct support on this matter.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAP/gpt processing codes can be used in these on-line and cloud processing services?\n\n\nSNAP is integrated in cloud environment, and there will even be some dedicated on-demand services based on SNAP  (i.e. S1 processing to coherence, etc). \n</div>\n\n\n\nIs a STAC catalog planned ? Will the data be accessible on cloud object storage (S3)?\n\n\nSTAC Catalog API is indeed planned.  Note that the phase-in will take from end of January to July 2023.  So services will be added during this timeline, not everything will be available at the beginning. All the data will be available over S3 as well.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill LTA process be discontinued when all archived data become online?\n\n\nThere will still be services available for so called “deferred data access” :  data collections that are not commonly used. That said, all most relevant collections will be available on-line.  The <a href=\"#/Roadmap\">Roadmap</a> shows how the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem will be continously upgraded and how more data become available.\n</div>\n\n\n\nWill the platform use STAC standards?\n\n\nYes, there will be STAC compliant Catalog API, as well as STAC items for individual products.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAny plan to offer the Pangeo platform for a “pythonist”?\n\n\nThis is currently not in the offer or roadmap.\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there any difference between EU users and non-EU users?\n\n\nThere is no difference between EU users and non-EU users. That said, there will be a continuity of the accounts with higher throughput, managed by ESA (i.e. Copernicus Services, International Hub, etc.).\n</div>\n\n\n\nWhich distribution channels will be available for high-throughput data access? I assume the public side (dataspase.copernicus.eu) has a bandwidth limitation. Or does the public side have user tiers, or is high-throughput data transfer (such as https://creodias.eu/remote-transfer-for-eodata) only a paid service?\n\n\nAll distribution options (i.e. OData, S3, Sentinel Hub,..) will be constrained with user quotas, which includes both bandwidth limitation, as well as monthly limits.\n</div>\n\n\n\nCan you give indictions about the cost of the “extra” services?\n\n\nPricing will be published soon.\n</div>\n\n\n\n This December advertisement of DAS says that “For those interested in processing, there will be scalable cloud resources available, optimized for EO tasks”. Does this refer to the current CreoDIAS resources, or something completely new that hasn’t been addressed yet? \n\n\nScalable cloud resources will be part of the commercial offering and can be obtained at <a href = \"https://creodias.eu/\">CREODIAS</a> in first instance. ICT-wise, there will be two options, including Open Telekom Cloud.\n</div>\n\n\n\nAre there tutorials (online & physical meetings) to use the new interface?\n\n\nTutorials will be added to the documentation in due time explaining the usage of the different interfaces. We will also be present on different conferences explaining the service & ecosystem.\n</div>"
